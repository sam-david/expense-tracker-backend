# ExpenseTracker : Backend

This project is the backend server developed for the Gigster coding challenge.

## Running server

Run `rails server` to start server. Use frontend client to interface with backend after starting server.

## Testing

Run `rspec spec`. Note: Tests are WIP as controllers were altered from Rails view controllers to API. Responses need to be handled differently in testing.
